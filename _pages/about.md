I am a Research Scientist at the [University of Southern California‘s](https://www.usc.edu/) [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/) in the research group led by prof. [Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/). I got a PhD in Engineering at TU Dresden at the [Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik).

Most of my current research falls within the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Agent-based Simulations**, **Social Computing** and **Network Theory**. I study complex machine-to-machine, machine-to-human and human-to-human interactions and address technical and societal problems leveraging the online and offline data.

### Current Projects
#### DARPA funded - “UPSCALE: Universal Population Segmentation and Characterization Algorithms for OnLine Environments” under [INCAS](https://www.darpa.mil/program/influence-campaign-awareness-and-sensemaking) **[Co-PI]**
Developing the next generation of tools and techniques for awareness and sensemaking of online influence campaigns, including their detection, characterization, quantification of confidence, and tracking.

#### DARPA funded - “DARMA: Dialogue Agent for Reducing Malicious Acts”
Developing a multilingual, adaptable system that mediates online dialogue so as to limit communication breakdown due to toxic behaviors. A mediator can facilitate discussions by removing offensive comments that violate community guidelines, inflame controversy or deceive, or by appealing to civility, acting as a role model, and, if necessary, limiting distracting voices when their contribution is detrimental to the community’s welfare. 

#### DARPA funded - "COSINE: Cognitive Online Simulation of Information Network Environments" under [SocialSim](https://www.darpa.mil/program/computational-simulation-of-online-social-behavior)
Developing the first-of-its-kind cognitive agent simulation framework for studying multi-scale dynamics of social phenomena in online information environments. COSINE’s multi-resolution, scalable framework will enables time-resolved, massive simulations of dynamic, networked information environments. 

#### Keston and ISI Exploratory Research Award - "Identifying Populations Susceptible to Anti-Science” [Co-PI]
We built a system for automated detection of anti-science and anti-vaccine narratives online. Our algorithm can detect the Twitter profiles to likely to spread anti-vaccine sentiment up to one year in the future.
