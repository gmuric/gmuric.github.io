I am a Principal Scientist at the [InferLink Corporation](https://www.inferlink.com/). Previously a Research Computer Scientist at the [USC‘s](https://www.usc.edu/) [Information Sciences Institute - Artificial Intelligence Division](https://www.isi.edu/). I got a PhD in Engineering at TU Dresden at the [Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik).

I am a Principal Investigator and researcher specializing in **AI**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Agent-based Simulations** and **Causal Modelling**. I lead multidisciplinary projects funded by **DARPA** and the **DoD**, tackling some of the most complex challenges. My work includes knowledge extraction from unstructured texts, combating online influence campaigns, multilingual translation for low-resource languages, and simulating information environments. I also study misinformation and extremist dynamics, with numerous publications in leading journals and conferences.

**Spring 2022** - [DSCI550 - Data Science at Scale](https://sites.google.com/view/dsci-550-spring2022/home)

## Previous and Current Projects
### **[PI]** DoD funded "Chemical Pathways"
Leading efforts to extract chemical synthesis pathways for target chemicals from extensive literature sources, including scientific articles and patents.

### **[PI]** DARPA funded "MinMod: Extracting Models of Minerals from Knowledge" under [CriticalMAAS](https://www.darpa.mil/program/critical-mineral-assessments-with-ai-support) 
Coordinating a team of developers and scientists to develop state-of-the-art data retrieval methods from large unstructured texts, particularly from large mining reports. This initiative is aimed at creating structured databases to enhance the utilization of critical minerals and uncover potential new mining locations for these essential resources.

### **[PI]** DoD funded "Adaptive Translation Engine for Minimal Resource Languages (ATE)" 
The project aims to expand the capabilities of a Massively Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system, focusing on providing translation services for low-resource languages in the Indo-Pacific region. 

### **[Co-PI]** DARPA funded - “UPSCALE: Universal Population Segmentation and Characterization Algorithms for OnLine Environments” under [INCAS](https://www.darpa.mil/program/influence-campaign-awareness-and-sensemaking) 
Developing the next generation of tools and techniques for awareness and sensemaking of online influence campaigns, including their detection, characterization, quantification of confidence, and tracking.

### DARPA funded - “DARMA: Dialogue Agent for Reducing Malicious Acts”
Developing a multilingual, adaptable system that mediates online dialogue so as to limit communication breakdown due to toxic behaviors. A mediator can facilitate discussions by removing offensive comments that violate community guidelines, inflame controversy or deceive, or by appealing to civility, acting as a role model, and, if necessary, limiting distracting voices when their contribution is detrimental to the community’s welfare. 

### DARPA funded - "COSINE: Cognitive Online Simulation of Information Network Environments" under [SocialSim](https://www.darpa.mil/program/computational-simulation-of-online-social-behavior)
Developing the first-of-its-kind cognitive agent simulation framework for studying multi-scale dynamics of social phenomena in online information environments. COSINE’s multi-resolution, scalable framework will enables time-resolved, massive simulations of dynamic, networked information environments. 

### Keston and ISI Exploratory Research Award - "Identifying Populations Susceptible to Anti-Science” [Co-PI]
We built a system for automated detection of anti-science and anti-vaccine narratives online. Our algorithm can detect the Twitter profiles to likely to spread anti-vaccine sentiment up to one year in the future.
